## Introduction
This project, "Vigenère Cipher Decryption," created as a part of case study on cryptography.
The primary aim is to demonstrate the use of  Vigenère cipher, a classical encryption
and decryption technique, to secure and decode texts.
This cipher, a polyalphabetic substitution method, uses a keyword to determine shifting pattern of text. 
By implementing this cipher in C++, project shows practical applications of modular arithmetic and discrete structures.
The program provides a menu-driven interface that lets users encrypt or decrypt text while keeping non-alphabetic characters unchanged.
This documentation explains the program’s purpose, how it works, and potential ideas for improvement.
  
## Features
  * Encrypt and decrypt messages using the Vigenère cipher.
  * Supports both alphabetic characters and special symbols.
  * Handles spaces and preserves message formatting during encryption/decryption.
  * Input validation to ensure robust operation.
  * Modular and well-commented code for ease of understanding and modification.

## Technologies
  This project is implemented using:
  * Programming Language: C++
  * IDE: NetBeans
  * Compiler: GCC/G++
  * C++ Standard: C++17

## Setup and Installation
Clone this repository:
* git clone https://github.com/username/vigenere-cipher.git

* Open the project in your preferred C++ IDE (e.g., NetBeans, Visual Studio, or Code::Blocks).
* Build and run the project using your IDE or the command line.

## Usage
* Launch the program.
* Follow the menu to:
  Encrypt and Decrypt a message.
* Enter the text and the cipher key when prompted.
* View the results directly in the console.

## Sources and Inspiration
* The Vigenère cipher algorithm was studied by cryptography class and online resources.
* Inspired by Cipher Algorithm Basics.
* Modular arithmetic concepts referenced from the "CIS7 Unit 11 – Chapter 5: Cryptography and Modular Arithmetic."
